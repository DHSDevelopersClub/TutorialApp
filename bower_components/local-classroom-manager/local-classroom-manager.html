<!-- Use ajax to pull a list of classrooms and then display them.

Has data bound published properties 'search' and 'date'.  Whenever they change,
the `load()` function is called.  `load()` sends an ajax request to
`/_ah/api/tutorialsignup/v1/classes` with search and date parameters equal to
the respective published properties.  `load()` then updates the
`local-classroom-manager` element's data.

Changes to the `local-classroom-manager` element's data are reflected in its
shadow DOM via Polymer magic.  All of the styling of the data is handled
within the `local-classroom-manager` element.
