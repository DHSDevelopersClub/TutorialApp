TutorialApp
===========

Our current goal is to create a minimum viable product (MVP) to demonstrate 
what our system can do.  An MVP means we will implement only the features 
necessary for the app to work and nothing more.  However, we will keep a 
roadmap of features we want to implement in the future.

As far as implementing the MVP, there are a number of empty files with
documentation of what they should do at the top.  Everyone pick a few files
and make a quck commit putting your name as the author.  Then work to make 
the file do what its documentation says it should.

MVP Features
------------

We must implement these before we can release Alpha 1.

  - Server
    - Respond to a GET request with the classes avalible on a certain date.
    - Accept a POST request to signup for a specific class on a certain date.
  - Web client
    - Mobile optimized
    - Polished material design
    - Login screen
    - Search screen
      - Displays list of all classes
      - User cant enter search terms at top
      - User can click/tap a class to signup for next tutorial
  - No admin client
    - No implementation for teachers or admin
    - Datastore viewer must be used to add classes
    - Admin client will be present in full release, just not in the MVP

Roadmap
-------

Anyone can add to this, but tag your addition with [suggested] so we can be 
sure to discuss it at the next club meeting, and make sure everyone understands
the idea.

  - Make an Android client [suggested]
    - Allow check-in with NFC
